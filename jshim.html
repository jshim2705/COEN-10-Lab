<p>Aside from the fun stuff, hi. Welcome to my website!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyways, it's me, Jaewon Shim, also called by the shortened first name "Jay". As of September 2023, I am a freshman at Santa Clara University, and I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Thisis the reason why I chose to be enrolled in any of the COEN courses offered by the School of Engineering department.</p>
